# GID-MTL
GID-MTL5 and GID-MTL15 datasets 

These datasets are used for multi-task learning of simultanelously conduct scene classificton and pixel-level land-cover classification. Every image in each dataset contains pixel-level land-cover labels and image-level scene label. 


The image is cropped from GID datasets [1] and set to a size of 224×224 pixels. The categories of the scene are the same as the categories of pixel-level annotations, except that pixel-level annotations further contain an undefined category. 


GID-MTL5 contains five land-cover categories. GID-MTL15 contains fifteen land-cover categories. The contained categories, the number of images per category, and some sample images of GID-MTL5 are shown in Fig.1. The same information for GID-MTL15 is shown in Fig. 2.
